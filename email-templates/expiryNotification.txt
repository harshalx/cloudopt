Hello User, 
Your instance {{ instanceId }} is about to expire in {{ days }} days. You can consider doing the following:

1. If you no longer need the instance and have finished your work with it, DO NOTHING and ignore this email. Instance 
{{ instanceId }} will be automatically terminated. 

2. If you have outstanding work that needs to be backed-up or if you need to convert your work into an AMI or Docker Images,
now is the time. Once you are done with this, leave your instance as it is. It will be automatically terminated.

3. If you don't want this instance to be terminated and hang around longer for your work to finish, hit the URL below. This will 
give you an extension of one week to your instance.

Thanks and Regards,
Your Automated Cloud Optimizer
